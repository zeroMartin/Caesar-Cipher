# Password Strength Check Tool
## Description
This repository includes two python codes.
The first code named bruteForce.py decrypts a text that is necrypted using the Caesar cipher.
The second code named caesarCipher.py is a code that encrypt or decrypt a text using the Caesar cipher.

## What is the Caesar cipher?
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code, or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

## Python code: bruteForce.py

This python code will use a brute force method to decrypt a text that was encrypted using the Caesar Cipher.

To run the code you must have the following python modules installed:
- os

To execute the code tun the command:
```
 python3 bruteForce.py
```
## Python code: caesarCipher.py 
#### **NOTE: Code is still in developments!**

To run the code you must have the following python modules installed:
- argparse

To execute the code tun the command:
```
 python3 caesarCipher.py
```
